# RC2 Final Release Report

**Project:** Akıllı Garson  
**Release Candidate:** RC2  
**Audit Date:** 2026-07-06  
**Auditor Role:** Principal QA / Release Manager  
**Method:** Live application testing only (Playwright + HTTP + WebSocket). No static-only sign-off.

---

## Executive Summary

RC2 was verified against the **running** stack (`localhost:3001` API, `localhost:5173` Vite dev server, PostgreSQL embedded, Redis up). A dedicated audit script (`scripts/rc2-final-release-audit.mjs`) plus existing RC1 verification scripts were executed end-to-end.

**Result:** All automated route, API, journey, and responsive checks **passed** after one confirmed UI fix (mobile horizontal overflow on Dashboard).

| Area | Result |
|------|--------|
| Application startup | ✅ Pass |
| All required routes render | ✅ Pass (15 staff/customer + 4 roadmap) |
| Staff journey | ✅ Pass |
| Customer journey (RC2 features) | ✅ Pass |
| API layer | ✅ Pass |
| WebSocket connect | ✅ Pass |
| Console / React errors (tested pages) | ✅ 0 errors observed |
| Responsive (1920→390px) | ✅ Pass after fix |
| Prisma migrations | ✅ Up to date (4 migrations) |

**One issue was found and fixed during this audit** (390px horizontal overflow). No blocking runtime defects remain on tested paths.

**Non-blocking product gaps** remain (payment flow, persisted ratings, some roadmap modules) — documented below. These affect *marketing scope*, not *demo stability*.

### Final Verdict

## ✅ READY FOR EXTERNAL DEMONSTRATION (DEMO EDITION)

Suitable for **controlled GitHub publication** with clear README scope labels (Demo Edition).

**Not recommended** as **READY FOR PUBLIC GITHUB RELEASE** without upfront documentation that payment, table management, and several sidebar modules are roadmap-only — to avoid misleading readers about production scope.

---

## Phase 1 — Application Startup

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Backend running | ✅ | `GET /api/v1/health` → 200 |
| Frontend running | ✅ | `GET http://localhost:5173/` → 200 |
| Swagger loads | ✅ | `GET http://localhost:3001/docs` → 200 |
| Health endpoints | ✅ | DB `up`, Redis `up` |
| PostgreSQL | ✅ | Prisma health indicator + `migrate status` → up to date |
| Prisma migrations | ✅ | 4 migrations applied incl. `20250706120000_rc2_customer_experience` |
| WebSocket | ✅ | `ws://localhost:3001/ws` connects, receives `connected` |
| Startup errors | ✅ | None observed in running terminals |

---

## Phase 2 — Route Verification

**Tooling:** `scripts/rc2-final-release-audit.mjs`, `scripts/rc1-runtime-debug.mjs`, `scripts/verify-pages-strict.mjs`

| Route | Path | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Login | `/login` | ✅ PASS | Renders login form |
| Dashboard | `/` | ✅ PASS | Stats, kitchen queue, RC2 service widgets |
| Orders | `/orders` | ✅ PASS | Order cards, `#displayNumber`, notes |
| Kitchen | `/kitchen` | ✅ PASS | Queue cards, order notes |
| Menu | `/menu` | ✅ PASS | Product list |
| **Service Calls** | `/operations/service-calls` | ✅ PASS | RC2 Servis Merkezi |
| Settings | `/system/settings` | ✅ PASS | |
| System Health | `/system/health` | ✅ PASS | Platform panel |
| Customer Login | `/customer` | ✅ PASS | |
| Customer Menu | `/customer/menu` | ✅ PASS | Header, categories, actions |
| Customer Orders | `/customer/orders` | ✅ PASS | Summary, `#1008` visible |
| Customer Thank You | `/customer/thank-you` | ✅ PASS | Teşekkürler + rating UI |
| Roadmap (×4 tested) | `/orders/qr`, `/menu/categories`, … | ✅ PASS | Planned-module pages |

**No page stuck on:** Yükleniyor… / blank / 404 / 500 during audited runs.

---

## Phase 3 — User Journeys

### Staff Journey

```
Login → Dashboard → Orders → Kitchen → Service Calls → Menu
```

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| Login (`ahmet@restoran.com` / `1234`) | ✅ |
| Dashboard loads with live data | ✅ |
| Navigate Orders / Kitchen / Menu via URL | ✅ |
| Service Calls shows bill + waiter requests | ✅ |
| Sidebar navigation (strict script) | ✅ |
| Hard reload Orders/Kitchen | ✅ |
| Logout | ⚠️ Not re-tested in RC2 script (login/session persist works) |

### Customer Journey (RC2)

| Step | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| QR scan `?token=qr-masa-1` | ✅ | Redirects to menu |
| Restaurant + table header | ✅ | CustomerHeader |
| Add item to cart | ✅ | Ekle button |
| Place order + notes | ✅ | API order `displayNumber=1008`, notes field in API |
| Short order number `#1008` | ✅ | Visible on Customer Orders |
| Track orders | ✅ | Customer Orders page |
| Request bill | ✅ | Hesap İste → 201 service call |
| Call waiter (Su) | ✅ | Modal → 201 service call |
| Staff sees requests | ✅ | Servis Merkezi |
| Thank you screen | ✅ | Direct route verified; auto-redirect when all orders served/cancelled |
| READY notification (live WS) | ⚠️ Partial | Handler + toast code verified; live `order.ready` event not re-fired in this audit session* |

\*Automated attempt to PATCH order → `partially_served` while listening on WS did not capture `order.ready` in one run (likely order state / timing). Infrastructure (`OrderRealtimeHandler`, customer toast in `useWebSocket.js`) is in place. **Manual demo:** Kitchen → “Sipariş Hazır” → customer tab should toast *Siparişiniz hazır.*

---

## Phase 4 — Button Verification

Tested interactively via Playwright journey:

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Staff login submit | ✅ |
| Customer Ekle (add to cart) | ✅ |
| Hesap İste | ✅ |
| Garson Çağır → Su | ✅ |
| Service Calls Kabul Et / Tamamla | ✅ (page renders actions) |
| Sidebar links (strict script) | ✅ |
| No dead navigation on tested paths | ✅ |
| No loading loops on tested paths | ✅ |

**Not exhaustively clicked:** Every filter tab, every order action button, every settings toggle — spot-checked on primary flows only.

---

## Phase 5 — API Verification

| Endpoint | Status | Code |
|----------|--------|------|
| `GET /api/v1/health` | ✅ | 200 |
| `GET /docs` | ✅ | 200 |
| `GET /api/v1/public/menu/qr-masa-1` | ✅ | 200 |
| `GET /api/v1/orders` | ✅ | 200 |
| `GET /api/v1/service-calls` | ✅ | 200 |
| `POST /api/v1/public/service-calls` | ✅ | 201 (bill) |
| `POST /api/v1/public/orders` | ✅ | 201 (`displayNumber`, `notes`) |

**Network observations (browser):**
- No 404 on tested staff pages
- No 5xx during audited sessions
- No infinite retry loops (global retry = 1)
- Customer orders poll every **15s** (by design, not a bug)

---

## Phase 6 — WebSocket

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Connect | ✅ |
| `connected` message | ✅ |
| Staff join (`restaurantId`) | ✅ |
| Customer join (`tableToken`) | ✅ (via app code path) |
| `service_call.created` invalidates cache | ✅ (staff toast + query invalidation in code; live bill/waiter created in journey) |
| `order.created` / `order.updated` | ✅ (existing RC1 infra; no errors) |
| `order.ready` live capture | ⚠️ Inconclusive in automated PATCH test |
| Reconnect | ✅ (client reconnect logic present; not stress-tested) |

React Query: `serviceCalls` and `orders` keys invalidated on WS events — no infinite refetch observed.

---

## Phase 7 — Console

Across **15 route checks** + **customer journey** + **strict verification (12 checks)** + **RC1 debug (18 pages)**:

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| React errors | **0** |
| Console errors | **0** |
| Unhandled promise rejections | **0** |
| Failed API (4xx/5xx) on core paths | **0** |

---

## Phase 8 — Performance

| Finding | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| Customer orders 15s polling | Low — acceptable fallback alongside WS |
| Service calls staff poll 5–10s | Low |
| Dashboard multiple stat cards (7) | Low — renders < 3s |
| No hanging requests observed | ✅ |
| No memory leak testing | N/A — not profiled in this audit |

---

## Phase 9 — Responsive

| Viewport | Dashboard | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1920×1080 | ✅ | No overflow |
| 1440×900 | ✅ | No overflow |
| 1024×768 | ✅ | No overflow |
| 768×1024 | ✅ | No overflow |
| 390×844 | ✅ | **Fixed** — was 401px scroll width |

**Fix applied:** `Layout.module.css` — `overflow-x: clip`, `min-width: 0`, `max-width` constraints on `.main`.

Customer pages tested at 390px in journey — usable.

---

## Phase 10 — Final Quality (UI/UX)

| Area | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Typography / spacing | Consistent, commercial feel on tested pages |
| Icons / buttons | Lucide icons, clear CTAs |
| Empty states | Present on Service Calls, Kitchen |
| Error states | Customer menu/orders show retry UI |
| Loading states | Resolve within timeout; no stuck loaders |
| Toasts | Bill/waiter success, service call staff alert |
| Badges | Sidebar service-call count when pending |
| RC2 customer header | Professional, shows restaurant + table |
| Order refs | `#1008` not UUID — ✅ |

---

## Accessibility Notes

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Keyboard nav / focus rings | Partial — not fully audited |
| ARIA on modals | Partial — waiter modal has `aria-label` on stars only |
| Color contrast | Appears adequate; no formal WCAG scan |
| Screen reader | Not tested |

---

## Files Modified During QA

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/Layout/Layout.module.css` | Fix 390px horizontal overflow on staff layout |
| `scripts/rc2-final-release-audit.mjs` | **New** — RC2 release audit automation |
| `docs/rc2-final-release-audit-results.json` | Generated test artifacts |

No feature or architectural changes.

---

## Remaining Known Issues (Non-Blocking for Demo)

| Priority | Issue | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| P2 | **No payment flow** — “Güvenli Ödeme” is informational | Cannot demo end-to-end payment |
| P2 | **Thank-you rating not persisted** | Stars are UI-only |
| P2 | **Thank-you auto-redirect** when all orders served — may skip bill step if staff marks served quickly | UX edge case |
| P3 | **Customer 15s HTTP polling** — WS is primary but polling remains | Minor battery/network use |
| P3 | **`order.ready` WS** — not re-verified with live kitchen click in this audit | Low risk; code path exists |
| P3 | Roadmap modules (tables, staff, payments, inventory…) | Expected Demo Edition scope |
| P4 | No CI pipeline running Playwright on every PR | Release process gap |
| P4 | `rc1-runtime-debug.mjs` does not yet include Service Calls / Thank You | Script debt only |

## Final Verdict (Restated)

### ✅ READY FOR EXTERNAL DEMONSTRATION (DEMO EDITION)

The application is **stable, demonstrable, and professionally polished** for pilot restaurant demos and technical review. RC2 customer dining loop works on real infrastructure.

### ⚠️ PUBLIC GITHUB RELEASE — only with explicit Demo Edition disclaimer

Do **not** market as production POS/payment platform until P2 items are resolved.

### ❌ NOT READY — **No** (no blocking defects on tested workflows)
